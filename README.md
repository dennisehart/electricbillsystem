# electricbillsystem
one of the projects for our programming class. 
the inspiration from this came from a struggle our neighbours had when it came too calculating how much they had to pay for their Meralco bill.

<b> This program features: </b>
- the calculator itself
- billing system where they can see previous balances 
- a feature that enables them to pay using the program

<b> note </b> this is a simple program and some features aren't able to actually save any info. 

shoutout to my groupmates who helped in editing this code: @Ken Escoto and @Giro Baylon
