# electricbillsystem
one of the projects for our programming class. 
the inspiration from this came from a struggle our neighbours had when it came too calculating how much they had to pay for their Meralco bill.
This program features:
- a calculator
- billing system where they can see previous balances 
- a feature that enables them to pay using the program
